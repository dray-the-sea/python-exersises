# python-exersises

This project just has a bunch of python problems (with possible solutions) to work through as you learn to code:

for-loops:
   1. iterate through a list of lists and apply conditional logic to items within
   2. iterate through a list of dictionaries and populate new data structures with items within based on conditional logic
   3. iterate through 2 dictionaries and perform mathematical calculations based on the contents. track max and grand total

functions:
   1. write a function that performs mathematical calculations and conditional logic based on 2 inputs 
   2. use 2 finctions to perform calculations on 2 dictionaries and print outputs
