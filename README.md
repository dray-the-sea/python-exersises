# python-exersises

## Organization
This project just has a bunch of python problems (with possible solutions) to work through as you learn to code. 
- Each folder has a theme and folders are listed here in the order that you'd want to learn, each folder's exercise builds on the skills that were used in prior folders. 
- Each exercise is named with [number]-[problem name]-[problem/solution]. 
- The solutions that I have listed are just the ones that I came up with and you can use them to compare what you did to what I did and check your outputs. Your solution may be different and still totally valid. In some cases I have multiple solutions listed. 

## Topics
### String Operations
/string-operations
   1. break up a long string into sentences, find first/last elment, find words that start with a 'b'

### For Loops
/for-loops
   1. iterate through a list of lists and apply conditional logic to items within
   2. iterate through a list of dictionaries and populate new data structures with items within based on conditional logic
   3. iterate through 2 dictionaries and perform mathematical calculations based on the contents. track max and grand total

### Functions
/functions
   1. write a function that performs mathematical calculations and conditional logic based on 2 inputs 
   2. use 2 finctions to perform calculations on 2 dictionaries and print outputs

### Pandas
/pandas
   1. import the csv file from the Kaggle Titanic competition, explore, modify it, and confirm modifications 
   2. import, explore, and clean up a sample workout log

### Pandas & Matplotlib 
/pandas+matplotlib: 
   1. import data into 2 dataframs, perform operations on the dataframes, and create charts
